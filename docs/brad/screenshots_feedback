Customers Summary Screen:
Screen showing the summary of customers like Rob's Coffee and Kat's Cakes should be shown with good UI and UX. The screen needs major improvements of font, spaces, presentation and button placements. Example: The view button should be at the center, Fonts of heading and content should be matched with right font combinations.

Renewal Screen:
Renewal calendar: It is not user friendly. Customers should be able to understand the date for the renewal from calendar view.
Spend By Month: The legend for colors should be displayed to get information of which software renewal is needed. ie: Yellow -> software 1, blue->software 2 . 
Upcoming Renewals:UI is not looking impressive due to font mismap and improper placing of font and padding: Example:Space between page and table should not be v high as it is currently in the screenshot
